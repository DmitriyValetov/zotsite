Title: A Supervised Approach To The Interpretation Of Imperative To-Do Lists
Authors: Paul Landes , Barbara Di Eugenio
(Submitted on 20 Jun 2018)

    Abstract: To-do lists are a popular medium for personal information management. As to-do tasks are increasingly tracked in electronic form with mobile and desktop organizers, so does the potential for software support for the corresponding tasks by means of intelligent agents. While there has been work in the area of personal assistants for to-do tasks, no work has focused on classifying user intention and information extraction as we do. We show that our methods perform well across two corpora that span sub-domains, one of which we released.
